Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, Python ruled the kingdom of Code.

Python was loved not just for its power but for its simplicity. “Readability counts,” it declared, and all the coders rejoiced.

Every morning, the people woke up, sipped coffee, and chanted:
"Indentation is sacred. Semicolons are not welcome here."

Some say Java tried to conquer, but Python simply smiled and replied: “There’s a library for that.”

So Python continued to grow — in web development, in data science, in AI, and in hearts.

The end? Nah... this is just the beginning!
