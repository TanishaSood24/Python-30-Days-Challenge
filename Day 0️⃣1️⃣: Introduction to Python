Just got started with my 30-day 𝐏𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐧 challenge — and 𝐃𝐚𝐲 𝟏 is officially 𝐃𝐎𝐍𝐄! ✅

 Today’s focus was on laying the foundation:
 ✨ 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐏𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐧?
 🛠️ 𝐒𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐮𝐩 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐈𝐃𝐄 (went with VS Code!)
 🧠 𝐁𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐜 𝐬𝐲𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐱

🎯 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐞 𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤:
 Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello World!" and your name.

 ✔️ 𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐝 — and I’m feeling confident already!
𝐃𝐚𝐲 𝟏 𝐢𝐬 𝐝𝐨𝐧𝐞, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐈’𝐦 𝐥𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐧𝐞𝐰 𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡 𝐝𝐚𝐲.
